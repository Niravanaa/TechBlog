            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">My First Day as an Intern</h2>
            <p class="text-sm mb-4">September 7, 2023</p>
            <p class="text-base">I'm thrilled to share my experience of my very first day as an intern at Genetec Inc. The sun was scorching, my heart was pounding, I hoped that my morning buses came on time. Here's how it went: </p>
        
            <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">A Cool Workspace Setup</h1>
            <p class="text-base">Walking into Genetec Inc.'s office was an eye-opener. The cubicles weren't like your usual office spaces. They were more like little clusters, which made it super easy for team members to collaborate. That definitely promoted teamwork, and I found it nice.</p>
        
            <p class="text-base">What also caught my eye was how everyone personalized their cubicles. There were Marvel and GoT posters. It gave the place character and showed that Genetec's employees were all about making their workspace feel like home.</p>
        
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Getting into the Internship Groove</h2>
            <p class="text-base">My first tasks came courtesy of the Internship Team. We started off by going through some legal documents and got a crash course in Genetec's products. We had to wrap up these tasks by the end of the week, so the responsibility was already setting in on day one.</p>
        
            <p class="text-base">The day wasn't a rush; it was more like a slow and steady introduction to the company. We joined the team's daily standup meeting, got to meet all the team members, and had a good look around our future workspace.</p>
        
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Team Up with Fellow Interns</h2>
            <p class="text-base">Here's the fun part â€“ this time around, there weren't just one but two other interns joining me in the team. It's not the usual way things go, and that got me curious about what Genetec has planned for us. We found common ground in being Concordia University students.</p>
        
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">Lunchtime Chatter</h2>
            <p class="text-base">Lunch was a chance to get along with the other colleagues of my team at the bistro. It was buzzing with other teams doing the same, and guess what? Many of them were also from Concordia, studying engineering or tech-related majors. It's clear that Genetec is all about building connections with local talent.</p>
        
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-4">So, What's the Verdict?</h2>
            <p class="text-base">My first day at Genetec Inc. was fun, I have to admit. The friendly welcome, the teamwork vibe, and the tasks ahead have set the stage for an exciting internship. I'm pumped to dive deeper into Genetec's world, learn more about their products and values, and sharpen my teamwork and technical skills.</p>
        
            <p class="text-base">This is just the start of my Genetec journey, and I can't wait to see what's next.</p>
