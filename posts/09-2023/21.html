            <!-- Internship Insights -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Internship Insights</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">My internship experience has been incredibly rewarding. I've had the opportunity to work closely with the company's SDK and integrate security solutions for our customers. As I've become more familiar with the technology stack, I've been able to assist more customers effectively, which is a great feeling.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">One exciting aspect of the internship is the project assigned by my team lead, a tradition for all interns. It's a chance to showcase our skills and creativity, and I'm looking forward to tackling this challenge head-on. Our team lead recently took us out for <a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://birdhousewings.com/">lunch</a>, providing an excellent opportunity to network and socialize with colleagues in a relaxed setting.</p>

            <!-- Diving into the CLI World -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Diving into the CLI World</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">Recently, I started reading <a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-command-line/">"Really Friendly Command Line Intro" by Tracy Osborn</a>. The command line interface (CLI) is a fundamental tool for software developers, and I believe it will become increasingly valuable in my career. Learning the CLI is like mastering the art of navigating your computer's file system and executing commands efficiently. It's a skill that can save time and enhance productivity in the long run.</p>

            <!-- Personal Project: Projectile Motion Simulator -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Personal Project: Projectile Motion Simulator</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">One of my most recent personal projects is a Python application for simulating 2D projectile motion and visualizing trajectories. With this project, I aimed to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                <li>Simulate 2D projectile motion.</li>
                <li>Visualize trajectories using Matplotlib.</li>
                <li>Calculate and display key metrics such as max height, range, and time of flight.</li>
                <li>Provide options to adjust x-axis and y-axis ranges.</li>
                <li>Allow users to toggle grid lines on the plot.</li>
                <li>Clear the plot for a fresh start.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-6">This project has been a fantastic opportunity to apply my programming skills to real-world physics simulations. Plus, it's been a great learning experience in GUI development with Tkinter.

            <!-- WPF To-Do Application Refactoring -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">WPF To-Do Application Refactoring</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">In my ongoing WPF to-do application project, I recently undertook a significant refactoring effort. I added the ability to assign a priority, due date, and description to tasks, allowing for more organized and detailed task management. This enhancement is crucial for improving user experience and productivity within the application.
