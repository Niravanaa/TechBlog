This involved understanding the intricacies of GraphQL queries, implementing pagination, integrating image uploads, managing post creation and rendering, and handling user statuses, edits, and deletions. Additionally, I gained insights into optimizing GraphQL queries using variables, refining pagination rendering in the React frontend, and deploying Node.js applications securely, emphasizing considerations for transitioning from local development to web deployment.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava, I learned about the growing importance of parallel algorithms in modern computing due to limitations in traditional speed improvements. These algorithms leverage multiple cores in machines to achieve faster processing, even reaching O(n) time complexities compared to traditional O(n log n) sorting algorithms. However, designing efficient parallel algorithms involves managing challenges like load balancing and task distribution among cores.</p>
