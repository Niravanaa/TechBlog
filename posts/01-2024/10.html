            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Course and Book Progress</h2>

            <!-- Thursday, January 44, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Thursday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "Svelte.js - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwartzmuller, I learned about dynamic styling in Svelte, including methods for adding or removing CSS classes based on conditions. The course provided a comprehensive understanding of Svelte's core syntax, event handling, bidirectional data binding, and components. Additionally, the importance of conditional rendering and loops in building Svelte applications was highlighted, with practical examples demonstrating how to conditionally render HTML chunks and efficiently manage repetitive rendering of markup elements.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Grokking Simplicity" by Eric Normand, I learned that functions in programming are defined by explicit inputs and outputs, with a focus on distinguishing between implicit and explicit elements. Testing and reuse are emphasized by separating business rules from DOM updates and minimizing dependence on global variables. The process of extracting a calculation from an action involves isolating the calculation code and transforming its inputs and outputs into arguments and return values.</p>

            <!-- Friday, January 5, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Friday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "Svelte.js - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwartzmuller, I discovered the significance of keys in Svelte when handling DOM updates and rendering changes. The absence of unique identifiers for list elements resulted in misaligned data and disruptions when deleting elements. Introducing unique keys, such as contact IDs, enabled precise tracking of changes, improving synchronization between data and the DOM. Overall, these courses provided valuable lessons in code design principles, abstraction, and reactivity within the context of JavaScript and Svelte.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Grokking Simplicity" by Eric Normand, I learned that the transformation of the 'add_item' function into 'add_element_last' showcased the power of abstraction, allowing the function to serve a broader array of scenarios beyond shopping carts. Additionally, I gained insights into categorizing functions based on their roles and responsibilities, leading to a more modular and comprehensible codebase.</p>

            <!-- Saturday, January 6, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Saturday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "Svelte.js - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwartzmuller, I gained insights into event handling in Svelte, understanding the use of modifiers like 'once,' 'passive,' 'capture,' 'stop propagation,' and 'prevent default.' I also learned about using inline functions for event listeners, considering both referencing functions without parentheses and using inline arrow functions for concise logic.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Grokking Simplicity" by Eric Normand, I learned that transitioning from mutable to immutable data structures involves encapsulating write operations into read operations. By adopting copy-on-write operations, calculations are favored over actions, resulting in more predictable and maintainable code. The course emphasizes the significance of immutability in nested data structures, demonstrating the copy-on-write paradigm to ensure data integrity and structural sharing.</p>

            <!-- Sunday, January 7, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Saturday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "Svelte.js - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwartzmuller, I learned the significance of structuring components and passing data into them. The development process involved creating a "meetup item" component to display individual meetups, distinguishing between stateful and presentational components, and organizing meetups in a grid layout using a new "meetup grid" component. Furthermore, I gained insights into setting up a form to add new meetups, binding input fields to data variables, and overcoming challenges in updating the meetups array. The course highlights the importance of component types, data passing, and form handling in building dynamic and organized web applications.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Grokking Simplicity" by Eric Normand, I learned about defensive copying in software development, emphasizing its importance in maintaining immutability when dealing with untrusted code. The rules of defensive copying involve creating deep copies of immutable data before it enters untrusted code and copying mutable data when it enters your code, ensuring data integrity and security. Additionally, encapsulating defensive copying within functions enhances code clarity and readability, providing a reusable and reliable solution.</p>

            <!-- Monday, January 8, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Monday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "Svelte.js - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwartzmuller, I learned the significance of creating modular components, such as a custom "TextInput" and "Button," to enhance the user interface and streamline the codebase. Crafting reusable components, like the "Button," promotes consistent styling and functionality across the application. The course also highlighted the importance of managing layout and content space in Svelte components, emphasizing the need for clear communication structures between components. Additionally, the module on component communication underscored the distinction between components managing data and those focused on presenting data, with the exploration of emitting custom events to facilitate communication between components not directly linked in the hierarchy.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Grokking Simplicity" by Eric Normand, I learned that extracting a for loop into a new function, indexOfItem(), optimizes the remove_item_by_name() function, facilitating a linear search through an array and enhancing code organization. The practice of stratified design, covered in Chapter 10, introduces four key patterns, with Pattern 2 highlighting the importance of an abstraction barrier. The abstraction barrier serves as a protective layer, concealing implementation details and enabling teams to work independently, exemplified by the transition from an array to an object data structure for the shopping cart. While abstraction barriers are powerful, their indiscriminate use is cautioned, emphasizing their value in scenarios with anticipated changes or uncertainty.</p>

            <!-- Tuesday, January 9, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Tuesday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "Svelte.js - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwartzmuller, I learned about event forwarding in Svelte, allowing communication between components through custom events. The creation and emission of custom events facilitate distinct actions for different buttons. I also gained insights into handling event data and learned to use spread props and default props for efficient communication between parent and child components. Understanding slots in Svelte enables more reusable components, allowing dynamic insertion of content within designated placeholders. Named and default slots provide advanced control over component design, enhancing adaptability and versatility. The practical example of opening and closing a modal using conditional rendering and custom events showcased the application of these concepts in real-world scenarios.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Grokking Simplicity" by Eric Normand, I learned that stratified design involves four key patterns. Pattern 3, Minimal Interface, stresses the importance of abstraction barriers that act as interfaces, advocating for completeness while minimizing complexity. Pattern 4, Comfortable Layers, emphasizes practicality over idealism in layer construction, acknowledging the challenges of extensive abstraction in real-world scenarios. The call graph analysis is a powerful tool, revealing insights into maintainability, testability, and reusability, guiding strategic code placement and testing efforts.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Wednesday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "Svelte.js - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwartzmuller, I learned about the power of slot props in Svelte, enabling complex interactions between components. The insight into Svelte component lifecycle, creation, and update phases, as well as lifecycle hooks like onMount and onDestroy, provided a foundation for managing component behavior. The use of the tick function in Svelte to handle tasks after micro tasks complete demonstrated the flexibility and control offered by this feature. The practical application of these concepts in the course project aims to refine component communication and enhance modularity.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Grokking Simplicity" by Eric Normand, I learned that adopting first-class field names for entities like carts and items in the API might seem to breach the abstraction barrier, but it allows for flexible implementation changes without disrupting external code. The use of hash maps in JavaScript for entity representation, coupled with data orientation, contributes to code simplicity and versatility. Simulating first-class status for elements, like the addition operator, showcases the potential of JavaScript functions for diverse problem-solving scenarios.</p>
