            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Course and Book Progress</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">I've been on an adventure, diving deep into the world of Git and GitHub. Let's take a look at what I've learned so far:</p>
        
            <!-- Thursday, October 12, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Thursday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I learned about handling merge conflicts, creating and switching branches, and using VSCode for efficient collaboration. It's essential to understand how to resolve conflicts and create clean merges in collaborative projects.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Apprenticeship Patterns" by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye, I discovered the importance of finding like-minded peers in the software development world. Learning and growing with others who share your passion can be incredibly rewarding.</p>
        
            <!-- Saturday, October 14, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Saturday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">On this day, my Git and GitHub journey continued. I delved into topics like reading diffs, viewing changes in the working directory, and mastering Git stashes. Git stash is a valuable tool for temporarily saving changes while switching between branches.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The "Apprenticeship Patterns" book introduced the concepts of practice and breakable toys. Continuous practice and experimentation are crucial for personal growth as a developer.</p>
        
            <!-- Sunday, October 15, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Sunday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Sunday was all about Git stash, applying stashed changes, working with multiple stashes, and understanding Git stash lists. Git stash is a versatile feature that helps manage changes effectively during branch switching.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">The "Apprenticeship Patterns" book emphasized the importance of using feedback loops, learning from failures, maintaining a reading list, and constant learning.</p>
        
            <!-- Monday, October 16, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Monday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">I learned how to check out old commits, re-attach a detached HEAD, reference commits relative to HEAD, and discard changes with Git checkout. These Git commands are essential for managing project history.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "Apprenticeship Patterns," I explored the ideas of recording what you learn and sharing your knowledge with others. Teaching and learning from peers is a valuable part of the developer's journey.</p>
        
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Refactoring the BlogWiz Project</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">This week, I focused on refactoring the <a class="text-blue-500 font-bold" href="https://github.com/Niravanaa/BlogWiz" target="_blank">BlogWiz project</a>, aiming to enhance its usability and flexibility. Instead of hard-coding my university's (Concordia University) UNIX server and port, I made improvements to allow users to enter their server address and port number, enabling a more customizable SSH connection for sending FTP files. This update enhances the project's versatility and usability for a wider range of users.</p>
        
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Wednesday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "Apprenticeship Patterns" by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye, I delved into creating feedback loops, learning from failures, maintaining a reading list, and reading constantly.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I explored undoing commits with Git reset, reverting commits with Git revert, understanding what GitHub does for us, and why GitHub should be used for open source projects.</p>
                
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Upcoming Projects</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">While I didn't get to work on a project this week, I'm excited about diving into an SQL online course and starting a Spring Boot project with a website application/dashboard. Let's briefly explore what Spring Boot and SQL are:</p>
        
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Spring Boot</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It provides a wide range of features, including an embedded web server, easy configuration, and production-ready metrics. Spring Boot is perfect for building web applications and microservices with speed and ease.</p>
        
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">SQL (Structured Query Language)</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">SQL is a powerful language for managing and querying relational databases. It allows you to create, modify, and retrieve data from databases. In my Spring Boot project, I will try working with databases using SQL to store and retrieve information efficiently. I will keep an eye out for additional derivatives like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.</p>
