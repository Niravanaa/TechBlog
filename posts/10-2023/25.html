    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Friday</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele,  I've learned about remote tracking branches. These branches act as bookmarks to the last known commit on the master branch of a remote repository and are referenced as <code>&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code>. I can check out remote tracking branches using the <code>git checkout</code> command. Additionally, I've explored how Git fetch allows me to download changes from a remote repository without automatically integrating them into my local working files.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In "Apprenticeship Patterns" by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye, I learned the importance of stability and adaptability in the ever-evolving software development landscape. It suggests that I should focus on familiar tools that I deeply understand while remaining open to better alternatives. The lesson also highlights the need for making tacit knowledge explicit and encouraging a community of learners in the software development field. Mastery in this field is defined by my ability to transmit superior skills, and it encourages continuous learning and skill improvement.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Saturday</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele,  I delved into practical aspects of Git, starting with "Demonstrating Git Fetch." This lecture stressed the importance of fetching remote changes, which may not be immediately integrated into the local branch. I learned to use "git fetch" to obtain the latest information from a remote repository and create branches with tracking. Additionally, I explored "Git Pull," a command that combines fetching and merging. I also gained insights into handling merge conflicts when using Git Pull and discovered the more concise syntax for Git Pull within a specific branch context. Lastly, I learned about the visibility options for GitHub repositories, differentiating between public and private settings.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://www.artofunittesting.com/" target="_blank">"The Art of Unit Testing"</a> by Roy Osherove, I encountered a step-by-step definition of unit testing and its importance in code quality. The concept of a unit test was broadened, allowing it to encompass a "unit of work" within the system. I delved into the properties of effective unit tests, such as automation, repeatability, and clarity of failure diagnosis. The distinction between genuine unit tests and other forms of testing was highlighted, emphasizing precision in terminology and principles in software testing. This knowledge provided a foundation for understanding what constitutes a truly effective unit test.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Sunday</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I started by understanding the process of adding GitHub collaborators, which involves granting other users the ability to push changes to a repository. Collaborators can make commits and push changes but don't have access to certain settings or administrative privileges. I also learned about the practical aspects of GitHub collaboration, where I observed the instructor creating commits as two different users, Colt and Stevie, to demonstrate the process of pushing and pulling changes. README files on GitHub repositories were also introduced, emphasizing their role as explanatory documents about projects. Additionally, I received a crash course on Markdown, a tool for generating formatted text with a simple syntax. Finally, I learned how to create a README file and its significance in project documentation and collaboration, along with the introduction of GitHub gists for sharing code snippets.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, I delved into the distinction between integration tests and unit tests, highlighting that integration tests rely on real dependencies and introduce non-determinism and inconsistency. I learned the importance of maintaining a "safe green zone" and preventing test suites from slowing down, especially as the number of tests grows. The book emphasized the characteristics of good unit tests, focusing on automation, quick execution, and simplicity. A unit test was defined as automated code that verifies specific assumptions about a single end result of a unit. The section stressed the consistency of results in unit tests as long as the production code remains unchanged. It hinted at an upcoming demonstration of a code-based unit test without the use of a unit testing framework, which will be explored in Chapter 2.</p>

    <!-- Monday, October 23, 2023 -->
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Monday</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I discovered GitHub Pages, a feature that allows for hosting webpages for free using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This feature is ideal for portfolio websites, documentation, and hosting projects like JavaScript games. GitHub Pages offers two types: project sites and user sites. I also learned how to create a GitHub Pages hosted website for a repository and customize it with an "index.html" file. Additionally, I explored the limitations of the centralized workflow in Git and GitHub collaboration, which encouraged me to delve into the Feature Branch Workflow. This new approach involves development work on separate branches dedicated to specific features, bug fixes, or tasks, reducing conflicts and disruptions in the main codebase.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, I learned about the possibility of writing automated unit tests without relying on dedicated test frameworks, an approach that was common among developers before the advent of test frameworks. This was illustrated using a simple example involving a `SimpleParser` class and the process of writing tests within a console application project. The section also introduced Test-Driven Development (TDD), a methodology where unit tests are created before writing production code, emphasizing its potential to enhance code quality and design. TDD involves writing failing tests, creating production code, and refactoring. When applied correctly, TDD can significantly improve code quality and project management, but it should be used with care to avoid project delays and other potential issues.</p>

    <!-- Tuesday, October 24, 2023 -->
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Tuesday</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, the Feature Branch Workflow was explained with a demonstration, emphasizing the importance of working on separate branches, preserving the main branch's integrity, and efficient collaboration. The process of merging feature branches into the main branch was detailed, including three integration strategies and their challenges. Pull Requests (PRs) were introduced, with clear explanations, analogies, and examples of creating and managing PRs. The lecture then delved into making the first pull request, with hands-on guidance for students. Additionally, resolving conflicts in PRs was explained, offering both web and command-line solutions for conflict resolution. The significance of configuring branch protection rules in a collaborative repository was highlighted, demonstrating their role in ensuring code quality and controlled development workflows.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, the importance of mastering the three essential skills for Test-Driven Development (TDD) was discussed. Crafting effective tests, writing tests test-first, and designing tests for a well-structured system were identified as key components. The chapter recommended learning these skills incrementally rather than attempting to master all three simultaneously. A good unit test was defined as an automated code piece that calls a specific method, verifies assumptions, and is created using a unit testing framework. The distinction between unit tests and integration tests was explored, emphasizing the value of unit tests in the early stages of a project. The chapter introduced the concept of TDD and highlighted its advantages, including high code coverage, test reliability, and its contribution to design and problem-solving. The next chapter promises to put the skill of writing good tests into practice using the NUnit framework.</p>

    <!-- Wednesday, October 25, 2023 -->
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Wednesday</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I was introduced to forking as a crucial concept in open-source projects, explaining how developers can create personal copies of repositories on their GitHub accounts without needing direct permission. The demonstration illustrated the process of forking and cloning a repository, emphasizing the distinction between having a copy on GitHub and on your local machine. The Fork & Clone Workflow was explored, highlighting the use of pull requests (PRs) to share contributions with project maintainers. This workflow is particularly valuable for large open-source projects, enabling collaborative development without direct access to the central repository. The demonstration reinforced these concepts. The instructor demonstrated a simple repository where one user forks and the other collaborates through PRs. Lastly, the section on rebasing introduced its use cases and the caution required when applying it.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, the book introduced unit testing frameworks as a solution to manual testing challenges, emphasizing their structured, repeatable, and comprehensive nature. The book highlighted the benefits of using unit testing frameworks to simplify test creation and automate test execution, thereby enhancing code quality. In the .NET ecosystem, NUnit, among others, is discussed as a prominent framework. However, it's emphasized that using a unit testing framework does not guarantee test quality, an issue explored in Chapter 7 and throughout the book. The book's testing project, "LogAn," was introduced, focusing on a scenario where a product needs to analyze log files and alert relevant parties. The project will evolve throughout the book, guiding readers in writing tests for validation. The initial step is the installation of the NUnit unit testing framework.</p>
