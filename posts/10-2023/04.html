            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Thoughts of Leveraging My Technicals</h2>     
            <p class="mb-6">For the past few weeks, I have been thinking about how I can use my internship to leverage my technical skills. So far, I have been mainly taking on projects that require little to no guidance from people, but only from the Internet. I want to delve into developing projects that involve a mentor. What I mean by a mentor is not that they will be teaching me everything and reviewing every single file of code that I produce, but instead a mentor that can help me figure out what features that the projects that I want to take on can have, and what resources to use to develop those features. </p>
                
            <p class="mb-6"> One project that I have been thinking of developing is a RESTful-based API, contianing its own endpoints and that can be readily used to obtain a specific kind of information from. I have not yet decided on the kind of information to have in a database, but I do want to be able to develop a RESTful API that anyone can use, and properly write documentation for it. I have also began getting interested in network-based projects and will try diving into those soon enough...</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Elevating My <a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Niravanaa/WeatherBot">Discord Bot</a></h2>
            <p class="mb-6">Dedicated efforts have gone into elevating my Discord bot's capabilities. I introduced a new feature that fetches weather forecasts for the next six days. Additionally, I seamlessly integrated a geocoding API, allowing user-entered addresses to be translated into precise latitude and longitude coordinates for weather data retrieval. The next steps include enriching the user experience with imagery in embedded cards and providing options for users to customize units for wind speeds and temperature readings, including the imperial system.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Books, Learning, and Future Collaborations</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">Recently, I concluded my exploration of <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-command-line/" target="_blank">"Really Friendly Command Line Intro" by Tracy Osborn</a>, which equipped me with essential Unix command line skills. Currently, I'm immersed in <a href=""Really Friendly Command Line Intro" by Tracy Osborn" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500">"Apprenticeship Patterns" by Adewale Oshineye and Dave Hoover</a>. This insightful book delves into the common patterns observed in programming apprenticeships, offering valuable insights as I prepare for my upcoming career journey.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">Looking ahead, I'm contemplating embarking/continuing on collaborative projects with like-minded individuals who share a passion for specific programming languages and software development areas. These projects will not only expand my knowledge but also contribute to meaningful and impactful endeavors. Stick around to see these projects come to fruition.</p>
