            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Miscellaneous Things</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">As I mull over the idea of attempting to pursue an extension on my current internship over the winter semester, I'm in a bit of a dilemma, weighing its potential upsides and downsides. Getting hands-on experience in my field sounds awesome, and it could really complement what I'm learning in my university courses. But, I've got five courses lined up for the winter semester. On one hand, the internship could help me apply what I learn at school while earning a bit of money, while on the other, I worry about juggling it all without burning out or letting my grades slip. It's a classic case of wanting to grab opportunities while also making sure I can handle my academic workload without going crazy...</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Lately, everyone's buzzing about these big language models like ChatGPT that can do crazy cool stuff—making texts, answering questions, and even translating languages! But, recently, there is this new thing going around called GPT Wrapper Tools? They're like the buddies of GPT models, helping you tweak and use them for different tasks. Here's the scoop: ChatGPT is perfect for building chatbots with a touch of AI magic. It's free, but the fancy new features need a Plus subscription ;(. On the flip side, GPT wrapper tools are like a treasure chest for GPT models. They're super user-friendly, offer pre-trained models, and let you fine-tune GPT-3 for your needs. They also come with snazzy web interfaces, cool templates, and a buffet of pre-built models for various industries.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">The frosty winter vibes have been putting a bit of a chill on my productivity lately. It's like the cold seeps into my bones, making it a tad harder to focus. I've been playing catch-up with my work over the last few days, trying to thaw out and get back on track. Side projects are on standby for now, but I'm hoping to dive back into them soon, once this winter freeze loosens its grip.</p>
