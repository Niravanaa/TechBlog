            <!-- Thursday, October 26, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Thursday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In <strong><a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/">"The Git and GitHub Bootcamp"</a></strong> by Colt Steele, I learned the advantages of using Git's rebase command over traditional merging. It enables a cleaner and more linear commit history by rewriting the branch history, which is particularly valuable in collaborative projects with multiple feature branches. The lesson also emphasized the importance of the "golden rule" to avoid rebasing shared commits and demonstrated conflict resolution during the rebase process.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In <strong><a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://www.artofunittesting.com/">"The Art of Unit Testing"</a></strong> by Roy Osherove, I learned how to install NUnit, a .NET testing framework, and discovered its open-source nature, along with accessing the NUnit GUI and Console Runner. I also gained insights into the fundamental principles of unit testing, such as arranging objects, performing actions, and asserting expected outcomes. Additionally, I understood the significance of proper test code styling, naming conventions, and test stage separation, aiming to make tests more concise and readable in future lessons.</p>
        
            <!-- Friday, October 27, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Friday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I learned how Git's rebase command can be used to edit, reword, and even delete commits while maintaining a clean commit history, a valuable skill for preparing code branches. Rewording Commits With Interactive Rebase highlighted the -i option's practical use in refining commit messages while preserving content. Fixing Up & Squashing Commits With Interactive Rebase showed how the "fixup" command can consolidate related commits, making commit histories more concise and comprehensible.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, I learned that NUnit's parameterized tests help in maintaining test cases by replacing the [Test] attribute with [TestCase], making test methods more manageable. I also learned about setting up and cleaning up using [SetUp] and [TearDown] attributes, differentiating between unit and integration tests, and organizing tests into categories using the [Category] attribute for better test management.</p>
        
            <!-- Saturday, October 28, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Saturday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I learned that Git tags play a crucial role in versioning and signify significant changes in software development, using semantic versioning for clarity. I also learned how to view, search, and compare tags in a Git repository, enabling effective management of project history and releases. Additionally, I gained insights into creating both lightweight and annotated tags, with annotated tags providing valuable metadata for better organization and documentation in Git.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, I learned that state-based testing, or state verification, is a critical approach for verifying that a system's behavior changes correctly after an action is performed. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining test code readability and suggests using methods other than testing direct state changes to achieve this. Additionally, I gained insights into applying NUnit for creating straightforward tests, using attributes for test organization, and handling testing scenarios without clear return values, all while maintaining foundational principles for effective testing.</p>
            
            <!-- Sunday, October 29, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Sunday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I learned how to tag earlier commits in Git using the commit hash, allowing tags to reference points further back in the project's history. I also discovered the use of the "-f" option to force changes in a tag's reference to a different commit when needed. Additionally, I gained knowledge about deleting Git tags and the significance of pushing tags to a remote repository for effective version control and collaboration.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, I learned that in unit testing, managing external dependencies, like filesystems or threads, can be challenging, and using stubs as controllable replacements for these dependencies is essential for effective testing. It's crucial to avoid relying on external dependencies in unit tests to prevent issues like slower execution and testing multiple aspects simultaneously. The book simplifies the terminology for testing patterns by primarily focusing on fakes, stubs, and mocks, enhancing the understanding of testing in C#.</p>
            
            <!-- Monday, October 30, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Monday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I learned that the HEAD file in Git, found in the .git directory, contains a reference to a commit or branch reference. It can enter a "detached HEAD" state, directly referencing a specific commit, which can be observed when switching branches. Git uses SHA-1 hashing functions for generating hashes, and these hashes play a key role in Git's data storage, with objects like commits, trees, blobs, and annotated tags all being hashed using SHA-1. Reflogs are important for tracking local changes to references, like branches and HEAD, but are strictly local to your Git repository and have a limited duration of around 90 days before old entries are removed.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, I learned that unit testing involves strategically adding layers of abstraction, or indirection, to improve code testability. These layers can mimic challenging components, reduce dependencies, and enhance maintainability. Additionally, refactoring and seams are essential for testability, where refactoring involves altering code without changing its core functionality, and seams are strategic points to introduce alternative functionalities, aligning with the Open-Closed Principle. These techniques allow controlled testing without modifying the code's original behavior.</p>
            
            <!-- Tuesday, October 31, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Tuesday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" by Colt Steele, I learned about the Git Reflog "show" subcommand for tracking reference changes and referencing historical states. The global Git config file enables consistent settings across repositories, and Git aliases offer custom shortcuts for commands, even with arguments. It's essential to explore shared Git aliases online for productivity but be cautious about personal aliases causing confusion when collaborating.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, I learned that in software development, introducing seams for testing involves various techniques, including Extract and Override, which simplifies testing by deriving from the class under test and overriding virtual methods. Balancing testability with object-oriented design principles can be achieved through techniques like marking constructors and methods as internal, using attributes for selective visibility, and employing conditional compilation to maintain code integrity while ensuring testability.</p>
            
            <!-- Wednesday, November 1, 2023 -->
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Wednesday</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">In <strong><a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/">"Vue - The Complete Guide"</a></strong> by Maximilian Schwartzmuller, I learned that Vue.js is a JavaScript framework designed for building interactive and reactive web frontends, focusing on client-side programming. The course introduces two main ways to use Vue: building "Widgets" to selectively control specific parts of a web page and the Single-Page-Application (SPA) approach to control and render every element on a page. It also explores Vue in comparison to alternative frameworks like React and Angular and offers a hands-on project that transitions from JavaScript to Vue for web development.</p>
        
            <p class="mb-4">In "The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, I learned about creating flexible "fake" classes for overriding dependencies in tests, particularly using the Extract and Override method and emphasizing the use of interfaces for streamlined testing. The concept of Test-Only or Object-Oriented Design (TOOD) was introduced, which offers advantages in terms of maintainability and test writing. I also explored interaction testing and the debate surrounding the use of mocks in testing.</p>
            

            <!-- Course Update -->
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">On to the next course...</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">I've successfully completed "The Git and GitHub Bootcamp" online course by Colt Steele. It's been an enlightening journey into the world of version control and collaborative coding. But, as they say, the learning never stops, and I'm excited to dive into my next adventure – "Vue - The Complete Guide" by Maximilian Schwartzmuller.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong><a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js, often referred to simply as Vue</a></strong>, is a dynamic JavaScript framework designed for crafting interactive and responsive web frontends. It's widely used for creating modern user interfaces with features similar to those found in mobile applications. Vue stands out as a versatile and efficient tool for web development, especially when it comes to building single-page applications (SPAs) or enhancing specific components within larger websites. It simplifies the development process, handling complex tasks such as DOM manipulation and ensuring a smooth, responsive user experience.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Miscellaneous Things</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">I discovered <strong><a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum's Law</a></strong>, which illustrates how interfaces evolve over time. Initially, interfaces abstract the inner workings of a system, much like a car's steering wheel and pedals. However, as the system gains users, implicit interfaces emerge, shaped by user expectations, sometimes leading to "bug-for-bug compatibility." This concept emphasizes the need to manage these evolving interfaces in complex software systems.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">During the recent <strong><a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctkW3V0Mh-k">Apple event</a></strong>, I witnessed the unveiling of a visually impressive 24-inch iMac, though it brought minimal changes beyond the inclusion of the <strong><a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/">M3 chip</a></strong>. The absence of a space black iMac was somewhat disappointing. However, the <strong><a class="text-blue-500" target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/ca/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro lineup</a></strong> was a standout, boasting up to 22 hours of battery life and significant speed improvements. The introduction of a space black MagSafe charger and all-black MacBook Pro options was a pleasant surprise. </p>
